# YT_dislikes is a twitter bot that allows you to know the number of dislikes (and likes) of a YouTube video.
Now it is not possible to see the number of dislikes in YouTube. This bot combines Tweepy and the YouTube Data API to extract that information.
To use it, tweet tagging @YT_dislikes and adding the url of the YouTube video and the bot will answer you with the stats.
